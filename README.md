# My Awesome Project
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

**Link to project:** (https://jabadude.github.io/blackjack-site/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was my first real project that I can say I'm 100% in love with. It marked a milestone in my coding journey and I created something extremely fun and dynamic. An extremely simple game of Blackjack.

## Lessons Learned:

This project is when things started to come together in my coding journey. I learned more about API fetches, as well as eventlisteners. I also learned how important it was to start commenting code so when one looks back at it, they know what's going on.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
